## Challenge 2 - Color Box Challenges
As a user, I can see a white square on the screen.

As a user, when I click on the square a word shows up (a color). Each time I click it cycles through a list of these colors (one per click) - white, green, blue, yellow, red, purple, orange.

Stretch
As a user, when the box is cycling through the words, the background is the same as the color word.

As a user, I can see many color boxes on the page all acting independently of one another.

Super Stretch
As a user, I can add or delete as many color boxes as I want. All of them act independently of one another. (icebox)
